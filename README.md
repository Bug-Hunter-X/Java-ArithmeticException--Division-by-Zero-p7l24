# Java ArithmeticException: Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArithmeticException` that occurs when dividing by zero. The `bug.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.

The bug is caused by a missing check for a zero divisor, which is a classic programming oversight.  The solution adds a conditional statement to prevent the division from happening when the divisor is zero.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in Java programs to prevent unexpected crashes.
